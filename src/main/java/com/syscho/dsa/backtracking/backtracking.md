# Backtracking Algorithms

## N-Queens Problem

The N-Queens Problem is a classic problem in which N queens must be placed on an NÃ—N chessboard in such a way that no two queens threaten each other. Backtracking is commonly used to explore all possible configurations while ensuring the validity of each placement.

## Sudoku Solver

A Sudoku Solver is an algorithm that solves Sudoku puzzles by filling in the missing numbers while adhering to the rules of Sudoku (no repeated numbers in rows, columns, or subgrids). Backtracking is often employed to explore possible placements and backtrack when conflicts arise.

## Subset Sum

The Subset Sum problem involves finding a subset of numbers from a given set whose sum matches a target sum. Backtracking can be used to explore all possible subsets and determine if any subset sums up to the target sum.

## Hamiltonian Cycle

A Hamiltonian Cycle is a cycle that visits every vertex in a graph exactly once. The Hamiltonian Cycle Problem seeks to find such a cycle in a graph. Backtracking algorithms can be applied to explore different paths in the graph until a valid Hamiltonian cycle is found.

## Knight's Tour

The Knight's Tour is a problem where a knight must visit every square on a chessboard exactly once. Backtracking is commonly used to explore different moves for the knight while ensuring it covers all squares without repeating any.
