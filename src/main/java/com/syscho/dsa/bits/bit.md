# Bit Manipulation Question

## Problem Statement

You are given an array of integers `nums` containing both positive and negative numbers. Write a function to perform the following operations:

1. **Set Bit:** Set the bit at a specified position `pos` in a given integer `num`.
2. **Clear Bit:** Clear the bit at a specified position `pos` in a given integer `num`.
3. **Toggle Bit:** Toggle the bit at a specified position `pos` in a given integer `num`.
4. **Check Bit:** Check if the bit at a specified position `pos` in a given integer `num` is set.
5. **Count set bits:** You are given an integer `n`. Write a function to count the number of set bits (bits with value 1) in the binary representation of `n`.
6. **Count unset bits:** You are given an integer `n`. Write a function to count the number of set bits (bits with value 1) in the binary representation of `n`.
7. You are given an array of integers `nums` where every element appears twice except for one. Write a function to find and return the unique element.
8. You are given an array of integers `nums`, where every element appears three times except for one, which appears exactly once. Write a function to find and return the unique element.
9. You are given two integers, `a` and `b`. Write a function to calculate the bitwise AND of all integers between `a` and `b`, inclusive.
